#Iris-data set

##What is it
The iris dataset is a collection of information on three different types of flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each flower has measurements taken of its sepals (the green leaf-like structures at the base of the flower) and petals (the colorful structures that make up the flower itself).

There are four different measurements taken for each flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These measurements are all given in centimeters.

The dataset contains a total of 150 different flowers, with 50 of each type. This dataset is often used as an example in machine learning because it is relatively small, easy to understand, and has a clear classification problem

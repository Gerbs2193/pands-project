What is it?

The iris dataset is a collection of information on three different types of flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each of these flowers has measurements taken of its sepals (green leaf-likes at the base of the flower) and petals (colourful structures that make up the flower itself).

For each of the above different flowers or classes, there are 4 variables. These are; sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These measurements are all given in centimeters. These variables describe different physical characteristics of iris flowers. Sepals are the green leaf-like structures that protect the flower bud and petals are the colourful structures that surround the reproductive parts of the flower. So, the dataset contains measurements of these different parts of the flower for different iris species

The dataset contains a total of 150 different flowers, with 50 of each type. This dataset is often used as an example in machine learning because it is relatively small, easy to understand, and has a clear classification problem. For this project, however, machine learning wont be used as it is beyind the scope of my capabilities. Ratrher, the project attempts to show how different attributes of the flowers are related to each other and how these attributes can be used to distinguish between the three different species mentioned above. By creating histograms, scatter plots, bar charts and a scatter plot matrix - I hope to visualize these relationships and gain a better understanding of the dataset. Overall, the project attempts to demonstrate how data analysis and visualization techniques can be used to gain insights into complex datasets, without relying on advanced machine learning algorithm to do so. There will be references througout of alternative and often more complex and informativ ways to achieve thos understanding completed by other sources. This will help educate the reader on the possibilites of the data analytics possibilities of the Iris data

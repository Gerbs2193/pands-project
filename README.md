What is it?

The iris dataset is a collection of information on three different types of flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each of these flowers has measurements taken of its sepals (green leaf-likes at the base of the flower) and petals (colourful structures that make up the flower itself).

For each of the above different flowers or classes, there are 4 variables. These are; sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These measurements are all given in centimeters. These variables describe different physical characteristics of iris flowers. Sepals are the green leaf-like structures that protect the flower bud and petals are the colourful structures that surround the reproductive parts of the flower. So, the dataset contains measurements of these different parts of the flower for different iris species

The dataset contains a total of 150 different flowers, with 50 of each type. This dataset is often used as an example in machine learning because it is relatively small, easy to understand, and has a clear classification problem. For this project, however, machine learning wont be used as it is beyind the scope of my capabilities. Ratrher, the project attempts to show how different attributes of the flowers are related to each other and how these attributes can be used to distinguish between the three different species mentioned above. By creating histograms, scatter plots, bar charts and a scatter plot matrix - I hope to visualize these relationships and gain a better understanding of the dataset. Overall, the project attempts to demonstrate how data analysis and visualization techniques can be used to gain insights into complex datasets, without relying on advanced machine learning algorithms to do so. There will be references throughout of alternative and often more complex and informative ways to achieve tios understanding completed by other sources. This will help educate the reader on the possibilites of the data analytics -8of the Iris data

Introduction                                                    

This Iris dataset analysis project aims to explore and gain insights into the relationships between various attributes of Iris flowers. The dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width for 150 Iris flowers. Along with the attribute measurements, each flower is classified into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginic or classes as I refer to them. 

The main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset using statistical and data visualization techniques, without relying on complex machine learning algorithms. By leveraging the power of Python programming language and popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I aim to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset that most could do with a basic python programming understanding. 

By examining the relationships between the attributes and the flower species, this project seeks to answer questions such as:

How do the attribute values differ between the different species of Iris flowers?
Are there any strong correlations or dependencies among the attribute measurements?
Can I visually distinguish one species from another based on the attribute values?
What can I lean about the Iris flowers by analzing their attribute distributions and relationships?
By focusing on exploratory data analysis techniques and visualizations, dhis project offers a beginner-friendly approach to understanding the Iris dataset. It provides insights into the dataset's structure, patterns and relationships, helping us appreciate the power of descriptive statistics and data visualization in uncovering valuable information from a dataset.
What do other research projects projects on this matter tell us that this project doesnt? What can we learn from these?

The absence of advanced machine learning techniques in this project allowed me to emphasize the importance of foundational statistical methods and visual exploratory analysis. By using histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and summary statistics, I can see meaningful relationships and patterns within the dataset, contributing to our understanding of the Iris flowers' characteristics.

Overall, this project demonstrates how a combination of basic statistical analysis, data visualization and programming skills can lead to valuable insights and a deeper understanding of a dataset, setting the stage for further research and exploration in the field of data science. The primary goal of the project is to analyze the relationships between the attributes - aka the 4 variables - of the Iris flowers and their species using statistical and data visualization techniques, without employing advanced machine learning algorithms as it is beyond the scope of beginners, or at least this particular beginner.
